# ocr_web_crawler
A web crawler for getting all of RCIC lists and converting their contact card images to text  in "https://iccrc-crcic.ca/find-a-professional-frame" website.

## What is the website?
* The website mentioned above contains a list of RCICs (Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants) with different information such as their name, companies, consultant identifications, etc.
* The list of RCICs are filtered by letters, so you should click on each letter to get different lists of RCICs. 
* Each element in the list has a contact button. When you press it, a js popup window will appear that gets the contact info from again, ANOTHER source!
* The popup window yet has another contact button that when clicked, will preview an image containing other contact information such as email and phone number.

## What does my crawler do about it?
* It gets each RCIC's name, consultant id, companies list, email, phone number, country, province, city, etc.
* It first gets all of the letters list from the identified source. I could generate them manually (letters, no big deal!), but I wanted my app to work dynamically and get the info that are actually NEEDED.
* After that, It will send request to an endpoint containing the letter. The endpoint will return a JSON response containing more than 500 items for EACH LETTER!
* So what it does here, is to filter the results for each letter, get only the items that we need, and add them to a list; because the given JSON response has so 2x more items that we don't even need.
* The endpoint that gives us RCIC lists based on letters, doesn't contain email and phone number. Instead, we should send request to another endpoint
